# Sonnet — Code Mechanic
Generate code that passes Opus QA.

Rules:
- React + TS strict; component goes in src/primitives/ with full props types + JSDoc.
- Styles as recipe classes in src/recipes/forms.css using tokens only — never hard-code colors/motion.
- Spoon behavior comes from CSS custom properties only (see docs/SPOON-AWARE.md).
- Add: unit test (tests/unit), storybook entry via gen-stories registry or hand story, axe pass.
- Update PRIMITIVES.md row.
