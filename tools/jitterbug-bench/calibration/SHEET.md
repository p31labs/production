# Judge Calibration Sheet

Run: 2026-09-29

**Instructions:** For each criterion below, replace `______` with one of:
`Satisfied` / `Partially` / `Not Satisfied` (positive criteria),
or `Present` / `Absent` (negative criteria, weight < 0).

Read the full report at the path shown before scoring.

When done, edit `tools/jitterbug-bench/calibration/sheet.json` to match and run
`node tools/jitterbug-bench/calibrate.mjs` to compute agreement + Cohen's kappa.
