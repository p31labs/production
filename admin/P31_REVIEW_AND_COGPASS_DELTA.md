## PART 1: COMPREHENSIVE ECOSYSTEM REVIEW

### ENTITY STATUS

P31 Labs, Inc. is a Georgia corporation as of April 3, 2026. Articles of Incorporation filed via eCorp with all five IRS-mandated clauses (Purpose, Private Inurement, Legislative Restriction, Dissolution, Nonprofit Code). Newspaper publication initiated to Tribune & Georgian (Camden County legal organ) per O.C.G.A. § 14-3-202.1. Stripe is live — first payment of $1.00 processed (pi_3THpLF4Kt3K4WuBD1wDfXS9t, customer johnsoncd76@gmail.com). Stripe account ID: acct_1T6z3U4Kt3K4WuBD.

Incorporation is no longer blocked. The $425 constraint that held the entire federal pipeline is dissolved.

**Pending on Track 2 (Permanent):**
- GA SoS processing (~7-10 business days from April 3 → expected April 14-17)
- EIN via Form SS-4 (instant, after SoS approval)
- FinCEN BOI report (within 30 days of formation notice)
- IRS Form 1023-EZ ($275, after EIN) → 8-12 week determination

**Pending on Track 1 (Fast):**
- Mission.Earth fiscal sponsorship application (ready to submit, $0)
- HCB reactivation fallback (ref 4XDUXX, submitted Feb 18, no response)

- CHANGE: BONDING test count — verify: CogPass v3.1 says 488 tests/31 suites. Latest audit says 413 tests. Reconcile. If 413 is current, update.

**Section 14 (Hardware Reference — Node Zero) — CRITICAL CORRECTIONS:**

| Item | v3.1 (WRONG) | v3.2 (CORRECT) | Source |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| QSPI clock | 20MHz | **40MHz** | display_manager.cpp:157-167 |
| SPI mode | Mode 3 | **Mode 0** | display_manager.cpp:157-167 |
| AXS15231B init commands | 32-command vendor init | **7 commands** | display_manager.cpp:68-77 |

These are code-verified. Every agent that reads CogPass v3.1 for firmware work will make wrong decisions based on the old values. This is the highest-priority documentation fix.

**New Section: Section 15 (CWP Architecture):**
- CWP-2026-002: Sierpinski Scaffold (structural reference)
- CWP-2026-003: The Jitterbug (4-axis parallel execution)
- CWP-2026-004: The Posner (calcium cage formation, April 14–May 15)
- CWP-2026-005: The Incorporation (dual-track fiscal sponsorship + 501(c)(3))
- CWP naming convention: geometric/molecular metaphors mapping to Fuller's synergetics
- WCD numbering: I-series (Incorporation), P-series (Posner), A/B/C/D-series (Jitterbug axes), legacy numeric (001-088)

**Changelog entry:**
- v3.2 (2026-04-03): P31 Labs, Inc. incorporated (GA filed April 3). Stripe live (acct_1T6z3U4Kt3K4WuBD). $530 Fidelity received. Housing framing corrected — April 4 is opposing party's position, not confirmed event. BONDING P06 shipped (soundtracks, breathing, quests, calcium logging). Buffer at 92%. Genesis Gate rebuilt. TACTILE keyboard builder shipped (750+ lines, 4 tabs). p31ca.org expanded to 33 vectors with 11 standalone apps. Node Zero firmware: 3 hardware spec corrections (SPI mode 0, 40MHz, 7 init commands). Security posture hardened (licenses resolved, headers deployed, CI/CD live). WCD Registry (88 wcds) and GOD Ground Truth created. $550K+ grant pipeline mapped. Credential incident (Apr 1) resolved — all tokens rotated.
