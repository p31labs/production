/**
 * GET /api/loom/memory — Lumi's persistent memory, folded from the log.
 *
 * Memory is DERIVED, never stored: the same scoped events fold to the same
 * memory on every read (deterministic, no LLM on the critical path). The log
 * is the runtime — a separate memory store would be a second source of truth
 * that could drift from the prev_hash chain. This endpoint is the fold.
 *
 * Scope: reads the SCOPED events (shared + the caller's own personal) and the
 * fold itself is shared-only (a personal record's content never surfaces —
 * see @p31ca/canon/loom/memory). The result carries the four tiers: episodic,
 * semantic, procedural, narrative.
