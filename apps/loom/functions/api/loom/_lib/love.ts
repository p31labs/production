/**
 * The Loom — LOVE ledger client + care-proof read.
 *
 * LOVE is the P31 care economy: a soulbound, off-chain ledger
 * (love-ledger.p31ca.org) that tracks care_score, sovereignty/performance
 * pools, and (via ERC-5192 soulbound badges on Base) verified-caregiver
 * status. This module is the Loom's ONLY doorway to it.
 *
 * Privacy promise: a care read returns what the ledger will attest — that a
 * DID is a verified caregiver, its care score, and its pools — WITHOUT the
 * underlying care events. The Loom can answer "does this family member carry
 * a care record" and show a gentle care presence, never the intimate events
 * that produced it.
 *
 * The ledger's GET endpoints are unauthenticated by design (reads); the
 * ledger's write path (earn/spend) is separately gated by HS256 JWT + nonce
 * replay — the Loom never touches it here. A future service-to-service token
 * (LOVE_INTERNAL_TOKEN) would scope a dedicated identity; reads stay open.
