/**
 * The Loom — chapter derivation.
 *
 * The log is the game engine. Progress is derivable from the events
 * the child (and Lumi) have committed. Each chapter unlocks the next:
 *
 *   0 — Fresh: no interaction yet (the Launchpad).
 *   1 — Met Lumi: the child has tapped, a human `focus` event is in
 *       the log. Lumi responds, the field is alive.
 *   2 — Lumi has ideas: at least one `propose` event exists. Lumi
 *       proposes, the child approves or defers.
 *   3 — The workshop: the child has approved or rejected. The full
 *       instrument unlocks.
