/**
 * Family view — one short page the whole family (and their agents) reads
 * together. The family-memory pattern: shared artifacts + the care circle +
 * the last shared events, with provenance always one tap away.
 *
 * Constraints (from the same family floor as the companion):
 *   - Shared-scope events ONLY. Personal records never reach this surface —
 *     the read path already filtered them out before this component saw them.
 *   - One sentence, no counts-as-scores. The care circle is presence, not a
 *     leaderboard — and it shows the SESSION's own care record, not a
 *     household aggregate (that needs a family registry this view does not
 *     have; it is labelled honestly as "your care record").
 *   - Every shared write gets a receipt (its seq), and the receipt links to
 *     /provenance/:seq — "prove what happened."
 *   - No Undo button: this is a READ surface. Reversal is a writing action and
 *     belongs to the chapters (where `color.repick` is already fully
 *     reversible). A read page offering an Undo that only appends an event
 *     would be a button that promises what it cannot deliver.
 *   - No auto-advance, no timers, no chip.
