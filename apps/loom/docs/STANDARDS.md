# Loom — standards conformance

The Loom implements, or deliberately exceeds, four external standards. This
file records which, to what version, and where the Loom sits relative to the
requirement — so a future contributor can see at a glance whether a "fix" is
actually a regression against a standard.

## WCAG 2.2 — target size

| Criterion | Level | Requirement | Loom |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) | AA | 24×24 CSS px | Exceeded |
| 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) | AAA | 44×44 CSS px | Exceeded |

The Loom's family floor is **48×48** (`--p31-touch-min`), with child/elder
targets at **56px** (`--p31-touch-recommended`) and **64px**
(`--p31-touch-large`). This is above WCAG AAA and above Apple's 44pt and
Material's 48dp guidance.

**Do not "correct" these down.** The W3C Mobile Accessibility Task Force
polled on 4 March 2026 on raising the AA minimum from 24px, with an action
item to draft a larger size plus touch-vs-pointer notes. The direction of the
standard is up, not down. The Loom is already where the standard is heading.

One audit to run when touching the buttons: the instrument chrome's 44px
floors (`.loom-*`, `.jb-*`) are deliberate — they serve the fourth audience,
not the three humans, and they sit above the 24px AA floor. The 48px family
floor applies to anything a child or elder touches.

## WCAG 2.2 — reduced motion

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is honored by collapsing `--motion-scale`
to `0.01`, **never** by setting `animation: none`. This is deliberate and
load-bearing: the chapter phase machines are driven by `animationend`, so
`animation: none` would silently stall every chapter at its celebrating
phase. The reduced-motion e2e spec proves every phase still lands.

The test pattern that guards it (Playwright 1.61.1+): `emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' })`
**before** `goto`, then assert `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches`
from inside the page. `test.use({ reducedMotion })` silently no-ops; do not
rely on it.

## DTCG — design tokens

The canon emits a DTCG-shaped export at `packages/canon/tokens/tokens.dtc.json`,
pinned to `$schema: "https://design-tokens.org/schemas/format/2025.10"`.

DTCG's first stable version (2025.10) shipped October 2025. Per the DTCG FAQ,
it is *"safe to use"* — many tools and organizations already implement it. It
is not on the W3C Standards Track (it is a Community Group report), which
means the format is stable for production but may still evolve. The canon's
`verify:parity` gate and Style Dictionary validation are the guardrails
against that evolution. `gen:tokens` regenerates `packages/canon/dist/tokens.css`, the DTCG
export, and the typed `P31TokenName` contract from `packages/canon/src/theming/theme-store.ts` — the
single source of truth.

## AAF — agent accessibility

The Loom implements Mozilla's Agent Accessibility Framework proposal:
`data-agent-*` attributes on interactive elements, plus a manifest at
`apps/loom/public/.well-known/agent-manifest.json`.

The AAF runtime contract:
- **Discover** actions and fields from `data-agent-*` attributes.
- **Validate** inputs against the manifest's JSON Schema.
- **Enforce** safety policies (block high-risk actions without confirmation).
- **Execute** through the real DOM.

The manifest's `danger` and `confirm` fields are what the runtime enforces.
`loom.propose` and `loom.traverse` carry `"surfaced": "agent-side"` — they are
agent verbs that never appear as `data-agent-action` in the DOM, and the
annotation tells the audit and any scanning model that their absence is
intentional.

The `port-audit` script is the CI gate: it fails if any `data-agent-action` in
the source is missing from the manifest, or if the manifest's structure drifts
from the documented shape.

## Agent audit trails — the prev_hash chain

The log is tamper-evident by construction. Each stored record carries a
`prev_hash` — SHA-256 (lowercase hex) of the previous record's RFC 8785 (JCS)
canonical preimage (`{ seq, ts, data, prev_hash }`), computed by
`@p31ca/canon/loom/hash-chain`. Rewriting, reordering, or deleting any record
breaks the chain at the next seq.

The D1 schema (`events.seq, ts, data, prev_hash`) is the deployed runtime; the
dev middleware mirrors it with a per-log chain sidecar so the local server and
the e2e suite exercise the same contract as the edge.

Two endpoints expose the chain:
- `GET /api/loom/verify` — replay the log, recompute the chain, return
  `{ valid, checked, brokenAt, head, expected, found }`. Never cached.
- `GET /api/loom/provenance/:seq` — the chain from genesis to `seq`, each
  record with its `prev_hash`, plus the recomputed verdict and the head
  commitment.

Both are registered in the AAF manifest as `verification.verify` and
`verification.provenance` (`danger: none`, `confirm: never` — reads, not
mutations), so the manifest stays the single surface list.

Positioning against the drafting standards landscape (all are pre-ratified as
of 2026-09):
- **IETF GAR** (`draft-sato-soos-gar-02`) — the Loom's log is a Session Audit
  Record: its `seq` ordering is the causal chain.
- **IETF AAT** (`draft-sharif-agent-audit-trail-00`) — the chain is the
  `prev_hash` + RFC 8785 pattern the draft specifies; the `data` payload is the
  operation-level record. Signatures (ECDSA P-256) are the documented gap.
- **EU AI Act Art. 12/19** — automatic event logging with auditability is met
  by construction (obligations applied 2026-08-02); 6-month retention is a D1
  lifecycle rule, not yet implemented.
- **W3C AIVS** — `/verify` is the first half of a self-verifiable proof bundle;
  the linked chain is the second.
