## Abstract

PHOS (Phosphorus Human Operating Surface) is a deployed, multi-node cognitive OS (22 functional cognitive surfaces, running across 7 production Cloudflare Pages sites and 8+ active edge nodes). PHOS operates strictly as a general wellness and communication support platform within pre-market, non-clinical parameters, featuring zero telemetry. PHOS-Sovereign extends it with: (1) data decoupling via a standardized `.phos` export format, (2) a NixOS module for declarative deployment, (3) an ActivityPub bridge for Fediverse federation.

## Compare with Existing / Historical Efforts

| Approach | Model | Cognitive Portability | Self-Hosting | Fediverse Bridge | P31 Differentiator |
|----------|-------|----------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Nextcloud / Homelab | File sync | No | Yes | No | — |
| Mastodon / ActivityPub | Social media | No | Yes | Yes | — |
| NixOS | Reproducible builds | No | Yes | No | — |
| **PHOS-Sovereign** | **Cognitive proxy** | **Yes (.phos export)** | **Yes (NixOS module)** | **Yes (ActivityPub)** | **Combines all three with an accessibility model** |

Self-hosting (Nextcloud/Homelab) and Fediverse (Mastodon/ActivityPub) exist, but none couple cognitive portability — accessibility profiles, memory structures, spoon-state — to declarative, edge-native deployment. NixOS gives reproducible builds but no accessibility model. **PHOS-Sovereign adds the standardized `.phos` export, a NixOS module, and an ActivityPub bridge** that shares care state (spoon levels, sanctuary mode), not just posts.

## Significant Technical Challenges

1. **CRDT sync across edge nodes with intermittent connectivity** — PHOS uses a local-first sync layer; the ActivityPub bridge extends it with a federation layer for offline-tolerant replication.
2. **Standardizing the `.phos` export format** — the Cognitive Passport schema defines the portable profile; the `.phos` format is a JSON + hash-chain package separating user data, accessibility profiles, and interface state from any single host.
3. **NixOS module reproducibility on constrained hardware** — targets low-resource edge nodes (Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32-S3 with LoRa); reproducible builds with rollback support and minimal attack surface.
4. **Selective disclosure in the ActivityPub bridge** — share spoon-state without doxxing, reusing the Cognitive Passport's selective-disclosure engine.

## Ecosystem & Engagement

- **NixOS community** — the module is designed for contribution and extension; submission to Nixpkgs planned.
- **Fediverse / ActivityPub developers** — the bridge uses standard ActivityPub vocabulary; P31 will publish a spec for "care state" extensions.
- **NLnet / NGI Fediversity** — submitted to the current Fediversity open call; P31 is active in the Fediverse community.
- **Neurodivergent advocacy & open-source community** — 22 Zenodo papers, 7 production sites, ORCID 0009-0002-2492-9079; all code MIT-licensed at `github.com/p31labs/P31-local-workspace`.

Validation via the live 22-surface PHOS deployment across 7 sites.

## Technical Approach

1. **Data Decoupling** — Standardized `.phos` export format that separates user data, accessibility profiles, and interface state from any specific hardware or hosting provider. Ensures cognitive prosthetics remain functional even if cloud connectivity is severed.

2. **NixOS Module** — Declarative deployment module that allows users to self-host their PHOS environment with a single configuration file. Reproducible builds, rollback support, minimal attack surface.

3. **ActivityPub Bridge** — Fediverse federation layer that enables controlled sharing of cognitive state (spoon levels, availability, sanctuary mode) across trusted family networks without central infrastructure.

## Our Live Footprint (Verified)

- 7 production Cloudflare Pages sites (canonical: ARTIFACTS.md)
- 8+ active Cloudflare Workers (from a fleet of 30 unique Workers)
- 22 functional cognitive surfaces (verified in phos/src/lib/sound.ts)
- Core BONDING engine: 95 passing automated tests
- Real-time health score: 16/20

## Why P31 Labs

P31 Labs is driven by direct execution, not academic abstraction. Founded by Will Johnson, an AuDHD engineer and former DoD civilian. As a single father to two neurodivergent children (S.J. and W.J.), PHOS was built from scratch over 16+ months as a single father managing AuDHD and hypoparathyroidism. Features like spoon-aware UI degradation, GRAY_ROCK mode, and SANCTUARY mode derive directly from the daily operational requirements of a neurodivergent household navigating severe systemic barriers. We are building the tools we needed to survive.

## Budget

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Engineering (edge federation, CRDT sync, NixOS module) | €15,000 |
| Documentation & Open-Source Commons | €5,000 |
