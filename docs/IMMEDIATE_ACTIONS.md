## P1: Open Collective Fiscal Host Application (TODAY)

**Goal:** Unlock tax-deductible donations and ASAN grant eligibility. *(Historical — Open Collective host is now active, and the IRS 501(c)(3) determination was confirmed 2026-09-23, so direct tax-deductible donations are also unlocked.)*

### Step 1 — Create/Verify Collective
1. Go to [opencollective.com](https://opencollective.com) and log in.
2. If you only have an **Organization** page (from image_9cb421.jpg), click your profile icon → **"Create a Collective"**.
3. Name it **"P31 Labs"**.
4. Add description: *"Open-source cognitive prosthetics for neurodivergent populations. Building the Jitterbug Sierpinski Orchestrator — a digital ramp for the mind."*

### Step 2 — Apply to Fiscal Host
1. On your Collective page, go to **Settings → Fiscal Host** (or look for **"Apply to Fiscal Host"** button).
2. Search for **"Code for Science & Society"**.
3. Submit the application with this exact narrative:

> "P31 Labs builds open-source assistive technology for neurodivergent populations. Our flagship project, the Jitterbug Sierpinski Orchestrator, is a cognitive prosthetic that captures overwhelming complexity, breaks it into manageable pieces, and converges on reliable answers. We are a Georgia nonprofit with 501(c)(3) status confirmed (EIN 42-1888158, IRS determination 2026-09-23), incorporated April 3, 2026. Our work aligns with CS&S's mission to make knowledge and knowledge production more accessible."

**Fallback:** If CS&S declines, apply to **Open Source Collective** (osc.am) immediately after.

### Step 3 — Connect Mercury (After Host Approval)
1. Once approved, go to **Fiscal Host Dashboard → Settings → Receiving Money**.
2. Click **"Connect Stripe"**.
3. In Stripe, enter your Mercury bank account routing and account numbers as the payout destination.

**No API/webhook needed.** Open Collective handles this via native Stripe + Plaid integration.

## P3: Mortgage Servicer Contact (By June 24 — Hard Deadline June 30)

**Goal:** Prevent foreclosure on 401 Powder Horn Road (corporate headquarters of P31 Labs, Inc.).

### The Script
Call the mortgage servicer and say exactly this:

> "I am initiating a loss mitigation package to assume this mortgage. My FERS Disability Retirement stream (SF-3112) is currently processing before the OPM. I need the specific paperwork to formally request an extension of the forbearance until that federal stream is activated."

### Have Ready
- [ ] FERS Disability Retirement filing confirmation (SF-3112 package)
- [ ] P31 Labs, Inc. Articles of Incorporation (showing 401 Powder Horn Rd as principal office)
- [ ] Mercury bank account statement (showing corporate treasury)
- [ ] CS&S Fiscal Host application confirmation (shows institutional backing)

### Follow-Up
If they say "no" or delay, escalate to:
- **Request a supervisor** — cite the pending FERS stream as federally protected income
- **Document the call** — note the representative's name, date, time, and outcome
- **If no resolution by June 25:** File an Emergency Motion to Stay Foreclosure (use the court strategy from BRIDGE.md)

**Draft Package (use Jitterbug orchestrator to build):**
1. Capture a brain dump: *"ASAN Teighlor McGee Grant — $8,500 for Jitterbug accessibility"*
2. Decompose into axes: Narrative, Budget, Technical Proof, Impact Metrics
3. Run parallel agents to draft each section
4. K₄ gate: verify all sections align with ASAN priorities

> "The Jitterbug is an open-source cognitive prosthetic designed for neurodivergent individuals — particularly those with AuDHD and chronic metabolic conditions. It is a digital ramp: a piece of infrastructure that allows access to cognitive functioning that would otherwise be blocked by environmental chaos."
