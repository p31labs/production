## 1. Executive Summary

We propose the **L.O.V.E. Ledger** — a privacy-preserving, soulbound care-accounting system built on GNU Taler blind signatures. The ledger enables neurodivergent families to:

- **Earn LOVE tokens** through verifiable acts of care (time-weighted proximity, HRV-aligned "Green Coherence").
- **Spend LOVE tokens** on care-related goods/services without revealing their financial history.
- **Produce court-admissible care artifacts** (hash-chained, WCD-46-style SHA-256 chains) that prove consistency of care while keeping private emotional state hidden from opposing counsel.

The system is already 80% prototyped (Cloudflare D1 + Durable Objects). This grant will complete the GNU Taler blind-signature integration and reconcile the on-chain ERC-5192 attestation layer.

## 2. Technical Overview

### 2.1 Architecture

| Layer | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **User** | DID:key + WebAuthn | Cryptographic user binding (no device-only IDs). |
| **Client** | Bonding App + economyStore.ts | Single UI source of truth; syncs to cloud. |
| **Ledger** | love-ledger worker (D1 + DO) | LOVE balances, care_score, two-pool accounting, vesting. |
| **Privacy** | GNU Taler blind signatures | LOVE issuance is unlinkable; spend trails hidden. |
| **Attestation** | LOVESBT (ERC-5192) | On-chain soulbound badge mirroring high-value reputation milestones. |

### 2.2 GNU Taler Integration

LOVE tokens are issued as **blind-signed digital cash** via GNU Taler's exchange.

**Flow:**
1. User's care_score crosses a threshold.
2. Ledger worker requests a blind signature from the Taler exchange.
3. User receives a blinded LOVE token.
4. User can spend the token at any Taler-compatible merchant.
5. The exchange knows the token was issued but **cannot track where or how it is spent**.

This gives LOVE the privacy properties of cash while maintaining a verifiable issuance ledger for tax/court purposes.

### 2.3 Court-Admissible Artifacts

- Every LOVE mint and spend is recorded in a **hash chain** (SHA-256).
- The chain is anchored to a public timestamp (Cloudflare D1 or Ethereum).
- A family can produce a **WCD-46-style chain** showing consistent care over time.
- The chain **does not expose** the emotional content of care — only the fact that care occurred.

### 2.4 Cryptographic Security & Roadmap

LOVE issuance uses **Clause Blind Schnorr (CBS)** — a real, WASM-compiled blind-signature
scheme deployed live in the `love-ledger` worker (2026-07-11, `BLIND_MODE='taler'`), giving
unlinkable care-credit minting with court-admissible, hash-chained receipts. CBS is the
**pre-quantum** foundation.

The **post-quantum** path replaces the asymmetric primitives (CBS scalar, Ed25519) with
lattice PQC — **ML-KEM** (FIPS 203) + **ML-DSA** (FIPS 204) — via the existing
`software/packages/quantum-core/src/pqc/fips203-204.ts` module, deployed as a hybrid
(classical ‖ PQC) envelope. Symmetric primitives (SHA-256, AES-256) are Grover-safe and
retained.

A **SIC-POVM** quantum-measurement track is documented as *future research* (it requires
quantum hardware and is not deployable in the Workers runtime) — see
`plans/P31-WP-PQ-2026-001_PRE_POST_QUANTUM_CRYPTO_SECURITY.md`.

## 3. Budget

| Item | Cost (€) |
|------|----------|
| Taler exchange integration | 8,000 |
| DID:key + WebAuthn binding | 4,000 |
| D1 + DO worker hardening | 4,000 |
| Testing & documentation | 3,000 |
| Miscellaneous (hosting, audits) | 1,000 |
| **Total** | **20,000** |

## 4. Deliverables

1. GNU Taler blind-signature LOVE issuance (live on testnet).
2. DID:key + WebAuthn identity binding (replaces localStorage device ID).
3. Single UI counter + cloud sync (economyStore.ts).
4. Court-admissible artifact generation (hash-chained care records).
5. Updated documentation and developer onboarding.
6. Post-quantum crypto roadmap (ML-KEM/ML-DSA hybrid) — see Work Package `P31-WP-PQ-2026-001`.

## 5. Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Integration | 2 months | Taler blind-signature LOVE issuance |
| Identity | 1 month | DID:key + WebAuthn |
| Hardening | 2 months | Worker resilience, tests, docs |
| Pilot | 1 month | Family pilot with 10 users |
| Post-Quantum | 2 months | Hybrid ML-KEM/ML-DSA migration (FIPS 203/204) |
| **Total** | **8 months** | |
