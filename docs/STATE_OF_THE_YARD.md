### Known Issues
1. AGENTS.md lives at `admin/AGENTS.md` not workspace root — quality-gate.sh check #5 will fail
2. P31-FUEL-BUDGET.yaml line 34 contains legacy term "reactor_temp" — vocab audit pending
3. Stale temp files in workspace root (P31_SHELF_MANIFEST.yaml.tmp*)
4. EIN migration (42-1888158) in progress — 40+ files pending
5. 501(c)(3) confirmed 2026-09-23 (IRS determination letter) — sweep of stale "pending" references ongoing
