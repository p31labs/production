## Abstract

The "love economy" is rapidly being colonised by extractive models: tokenised dating, AI companions, and sentiment exchanges that commodify human connection. We present an alternative: a non‑extractive, legally‑recognised care economy built on the LOVE Ledger, a SHA‑256 hash‑chained, timestamped, Ed25519‑signed ledger that records care contributions as attested receipts—multi‑signature attestations from trusted peers. This system is embedded in a spoon‑aware interface and a network nation stack.

Crucially, the ledger distinguishes between inward and outward care: self-care regenerates cognitive capacity (spoons) privately, while peer-care mints LOVE tokens publicly. We demonstrate Proof of Love (PoL) consensus through cooperative games (Bashball, Bonding) where players earn LOVE by spending spoons to help others. To secure the economy against collusion, the ledger employs a mathematical decay curve on repeated pairwise interactions, enforcing the outward expansion of trust. We argue that this offers a path toward a love‑based civilisation—one where care work is measurable, rewarded, legally protected, and rigorously authenticated.

## 1. Introduction: The Commodification of Intimacy

Over one-third of 18–24 year olds believe they will never find love. The market response has been swift and extractive: AI companions (Character.ai, Replika) projected to reach $31.1B by 2032, tokenised dating platforms (DropD, Metya), and academic proposals to trade "sentiment" as a financial instrument. These models monetize loneliness and intimacy without reciprocity or genuine care.

Simultaneously, the "Network State" movement (Srinivasan, 2024) has pursued territorial exit, funded by venture capital and built on extraction. In contrast, the Network Nation framework (Network Nations Alliance, 2026) pursues functional sovereignty—the right and capacity to exercise authority in digitally mediated spaces—through community-rooted, commons-driven stewardship.

This paper presents P31's implementation of a Network Nation care economy. It addresses two critical vulnerabilities inherent to digital care ledgers: the Oracle Problem (how to verify off-chain care) and the Collusion Loop (how to prevent Sybil attacks). Our solutions—attested multi-signature receipts and diminishing returns on repeated pairings—provide the legal and mathematical foundation for a genuinely non-extractive love economy.

## 2. The Care Economy Stack

P31's infrastructure delivers functional sovereignty across seven layers, providing the substrate for the LOVE Ledger:

| Layer | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identity** | PQDID (did:key + did:web + ML‑DSA‑65), Cognitive Passport (SD‑JWT VC) |
| **Governance** | 501(c)(3) nonprofit, LOVE token (two‑pool vesting – see §3), Wyoming DUNA (proposed) |
| **Economy** | LOVE Ledger, LOVE token, GNU Taler integration (privacy‑preserving payments) |
| **Culture** | 18 pilot families (initial web of trust – see §6), spoon‑aware UI, crisis mode |
| **Infrastructure** | Cloudflare Workers (15), D1 (10 cap), R2 (3), sovereign HTML |
| **Design** | Sovereign Design System (tokens.yml + components.yml), MCP server, A2UI export |
| **Games** | Cooperative Bashball, cooperative Bonding, shared Arcade |

## 3. The LOVE Ledger and Attestation

The LOVE Ledger is a SHA‑256 hash‑chained, timestamped, Ed25519‑signed database. Each entry (receipt) records an act of care. However, a cryptographic signature can only prove that Identity X submitted Data Y at Time Z. It cannot prove that the physical or emotional act of care actually occurred, or that it was done with genuine empathy.

To solve this Oracle Problem, the LOVE Ledger requires **multi-signature attestation** for outward care.

- **Two signatures required:** The giver and the receiver (or a witnessing peer) must both sign the receipt.
- **Legal admissibility:** With two signatures, the receipt transitions from a unilateral claim into a mutual agreement. This transforms the ledger from a mere diary into a legally cognizable record of care.
- **Co-signed analogue:** This is analogous to endorsing a cheque. Both parties must agree that the care occurred.

The system stores the SHA-256 hash of the action, the timestamp, and the public keys of both parties. This creates a verifiable, court-admissible web of trust.

**Two‑pool vesting:** The LOVE token is non‑extractive by design. When LOVE is minted, 50% goes to the **sovereignty pool** (time‑locked, non‑transferable, can only be used for governance or staking), and 50% goes to the **performance pool** (liquid, transferable, but subject to a care‑score multiplier). This prevents a "dump" of LOVE on exchanges and ensures that economic gains align with sustained care contributions.

## 4. Proof of Love (PoL) Framework

The DAism Research Group (2025) proposed Proof of Love as a consensus mechanism for a future where AI and humans co‑govern. PoL is defined as:

> A consensus mechanism based on empathy, reciprocity, and creative cooperation, measured through contributions that increase the well‑being of the collective.

We implement this through three measurable channels:

- **Empathy** → peer-care contributions (minted LOVE credits).
- **Reciprocity** → LOVE credits earned from others, with a two‑pool vesting mechanism (non‑extractive).
- **Creative cooperation** → LOVE earned through cooperative play (Bashball, Bonding).

This is the first working PoL implementation.

## 5. Reward Mechanism and Game Loop

LOVE is minted solely through cooperative, attested actions. Base rewards are set to reflect the cognitive and social effort required.

| Game / Environment | Action | Base LOVE (R_base) | Attestation Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bonding** | Complete a molecule with help | 25 | Yes (both sign) |
| **Bonding** | Assist on a puzzle (2+ moves) | 10 | Yes (recipient signs) |
| **Bashball** | Assist on a run (pass before score) | 15 | Yes (teammate signs) |
| **Bashball** | Teamwork bonus (3+ touches) | 10 | Yes (all sign) |
| **Arcade** | Ambient engagement (30s) | 0 (Regenerates Spoons) | No |

*Note: All base rewards are subject to the Diminishing Returns on Repeated Pairings (DRRP) multiplier (see §7).*

## 6. Privacy and the Self-Care Paradox

Care dynamics are not strictly reciprocal. Care directed inward (self-care) is structurally distinct from care directed outward (peer-care). Early iterations of the LOVE Ledger required peer attestation for self-care, creating a privacy paradox where vulnerable, regenerative states required public witnesses.

V2.1 resolves this by **decoupling minting from regeneration**.

Ambient engagement (e.g., spending time in the Arcade) does not mint new LOVE tokens; rather, it regenerates a user's spoons (cognitive capacity, up to a cap of 5). This preserves total privacy for self-care while equipping the user with the internal resources necessary to perform outward, attested care work later. This aligns with the non-reciprocal care dynamics modelled in our earlier work (Johnson, 2025).

**The 18 pilot families** serve as the genesis web of trust. They are the initial attestors for new members, providing a human‑scale bootstrap for the attestation network. This group acts as a "trust anchor" until the network reaches sufficient scale to be self‑certifying.

## 7. Economic Security: Sybil Resistance and DRRP

By relying on peer attestation, the network opens a vector for Sybil attacks via **Collusion Rings**, where two users continuously attest to each other's actions to strip-mine the token pool.

To preserve the boundary between moral duty and supererogatory allocation (resources directed beyond duty), the ledger prevents closed-loop farming using **Diminishing Returns on Repeated Pairings (DRRP)**.

The reward for any given pair decays logarithmically based on their interaction history:

```
R_n = R_base / (1 + log2(1 + n))
```

Where `R_n` is the minted reward, `R_base` is the base reward for the action, and `n` is the number of prior attested interactions between that specific pair of DIDs.

| Interaction # (n) | Reward (R_n, base=25) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 25 LOVE |
| 2 | 15 LOVE |
| 3 | 11 LOVE |
| 5 | 7 LOVE |
| 10 | 4 LOVE |
| 20 | 2 LOVE |

Analogous to a PageRank damping factor, DRRP forces the economy outward. The Relational Closure Theorem (Johnson, 2026) states that love cannot exist as a non-recursive terminal state; DRRP mechanically enforces this by making isolated, recursive loops economically unsustainable. To earn sustained LOVE, users must continuously expand their web of trust and care for new peers.

**Pair ID normalization:** The pair ID is the lexicographically sorted, lower‑cased concatenation of the two DIDs: `pairId = [didA.toLowerCase(), didB.toLowerCase()].sort().join(':')`. This ensures the pair order is deterministic regardless of which party initiates the attestation.

## 8. Implementation Specification

The LOVE Ledger Worker and game endpoints implement DRRP as follows:

```typescript
// LOVE_REWARDS_CONFIG
const BASE_REWARDS: Record<string, number> = {
  bonding_complete: 25,
  bonding_assist: 10,
  bashball_assist: 15,
  bashball_teamwork: 10,
};

// DRRP Calculation — async, with D1 database
async function getDRRPMultiplier(pairId: string, db: D1Database): Promise<number> {
  const result = await db.prepare(
    "SELECT count FROM attestations WHERE pair_id = ?"
  ).bind(pairId).first<{ count: number }>();
  const n = result?.count || 0;
  return 1 / (1 + Math.log2(1 + n));
}

// Attestation Endpoint — POST /love/attest
// Accepts { giver_did, receiver_did, action }
// Returns { ok, pair_id, action, base_reward, multiplier, reward, interaction_count }
```

**Deployed endpoint:** `POST https://federation.p31ca.org/love/attest`

**D1 table schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS attestations (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  pair_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  giver_did TEXT NOT NULL,
  receiver_did TEXT NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  last_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (unixepoch())
);
```

## 9. Conclusion

P31's LOVE Ledger and care economy is the first practical implementation of Proof of Love consensus that addresses the Oracle problem (through multi-signature attestation) and the Collusion Loop (through DRRP). It provides a non‑extractive alternative to the commodified love economy, grounded in court‑admissible care receipts, spoon‑aware design, and a full network nation stack.

The system demonstrates that love—understood as empathy, reciprocity, and creative cooperation—can be measured, rewarded, and legally protected, paving the way for a love‑based civilisation.
