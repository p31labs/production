# SWARM CWP: P31 Sovereign Network — A Reference Implementation of the Network Nation Stack

**Date:** July 22, 2026
**Status:** DRAFT
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

P31 is a sovereign, neurodivergent-first digital infrastructure that implements six of seven layers of the Network Nation stack. Built on a foundation of PQDID (post-quantum decentralized identity), the LOVE Ledger for mutual credit accounting, and court-admissible hash chains for dispute resolution, P31 provides families and communities with the tools to self-govern, coordinate care, and build functional sovereignty outside traditional nation-state structures.

This Community White Paper (CWP) documents the current state of the P31 ecosystem, its strategic position relative to emerging industry standards (A2UI v0.9, MCP design system servers, Wyoming DUNA), and a prioritized roadmap for completing the Network Nation stack.

## 1. Introduction: The Network Nation Thesis

The concept of Network Nations has moved from philosophy to governance engineering. As defined by the Network Nations Alliance:

> "Network Nations aim to provide an institutional framework for emergent political communities of kinship to govern and coordinate themselves through networked technologies, creating new layers of sovereignty that subsist beyond the reach of nation states and private corporations."

Unlike Network States—which follow a start-up logic of territorial acquisition and exit—Network Nations are:

| Dimension | Network States | Network Nations |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Sovereignty model | Territorial | Functional |
| Governance orientation | Top-down, investor-driven | Bottom-up, community-driven |
| Path to legitimacy | Exit-based (capital, land, secession) | Practice-based (care, participation, belonging) |
| Membership structure | Market-based | Stake-based (co-creators and stewards) |
| Organizing logic | Market logic (CEO/founder) | Commons logic (collective stewardship) |



P31 is a pure implementation of the Network Nations model—infrastructure as territory, sovereignty through care and coordination rather than coercion and borders.

## 2. The P31 Stack: 6 of 7 Layers

### 2.1 Layer 1: Identity — PQDID (Post-Quantum Decentralized ID)

P31 implements post-quantum-resistant decentralized identity, providing cryptographic assurance of personhood without reliance on centralized registrars. This is the foundational layer upon which all other sovereignty functions depend.

### 2.2 Layer 2: Finance — LOVE Ledger

The LOVE Ledger is a mutual credit accounting system that enables families and communities to track and settle care contributions, resource exchanges, and value flows without fiat currency intermediaries. Unlike blockchain-based systems, LOVE uses a double-entry accounting model optimized for community-scale coordination.

### 2.3 Layer 3: Dispute Resolution — DRRP (Dispute Resolution & Reconciliation Protocol)

Court-admissible hash chains provide immutable evidence trails for disputes, enabling off-chain resolution with on-chain verification. The DRRP bridges the gap between cryptographic guarantees and legal enforceability.

### 2.4 Layer 4: Interface — A2UI v0.9 Compatible Renderer

P31's custom A2UI renderer is aligned with Google's A2UI v0.9 standard—a framework-agnostic standard that lets AI agents declare UI intent and render it natively across web, mobile, and desktop without shipping arbitrary code. A2UI 0.9 adds:

- **Client-defined functions** (perfect for validation and data sync)
- **Client-to-server data syncing** (collaborative editing with agents)
- **Simplified, modular schema** with improved error handling

> "A2UI v0.9 introduces a framework-agnostic standard designed to help AI agents generate real-time, tailored UI widgets using a company's existing design system."

Any agent that speaks AG-UI can drive A2UI v0.9 on day zero.

### 2.5 Layer 5: Design System — P31 Sovereign Design System MCP Server

The P31 design-mcp server provides **15 tools** across the full design system lifecycle:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Query** | `token_resolve`, `component_schema`, `component_usage`, `component_search`, `token_list`, `list_icons`, `get_icon`, `icon_search`, `icon_preview` |
| **Layout** | `layout_generate` |
| **Proposal** | `propose_component`, `propose_icon`, `propose_token` |
| **Validation** | `validate_component`, `audit_tokens` |

This completes the **query → proposal → validation → evolution** loop—a pattern emerging as the next frontier in design-system MCP servers.

### 2.6 Layer 6: Agentic Infrastructure — MCP Tooling

The P31 CLI (`@p31ca/cli`) provides **26 tools across 7 categories**, with spoon-aware UI that adapts to cognitive load levels (1/3/5). The CLI enables:

- Interactive chat sessions with sovereign agents
- Autonomous agent execution
- Terminal streaming via WebSocket
- MCP tool management
- Cognitive load level setting

## 3. The Missing Layer: Legal Wrapper & Public Narrative

### 3.1 Wyoming DUNA: The Emerging Standard

The Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act has become the standard legal wrapper for DAOs and decentralized communities.

**Key provisions:**

- **Separate entity treatment**: A DUNA is treated as a legal entity separate from its members for contract and tort rights, duties, and liabilities.
- **Member liability limits**: Members and administrators are not liable for a DUNA's contract or tort obligation merely because of their status or participation in management.
- **On-chain governance**: Governing principles may specify voting procedures, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and whether distributed ledger technology is public, private, immutable, or changeable.
- **Property and court capacity**: A DUNA may hold and transfer real or personal property and may sue, defend, or participate in judicial, administrative, arbitration, or mediation proceedings in its own name.
- **Nonprofit purpose**: A DUNA may conduct profit-making activity, but profits must be used for, or set aside for, the common nonprofit purpose.

**Recent developments (2026):**

- **Senate File 22**, effective July 1, 2026, amends DUNA laws.
- **SaucerSwap DAO** allocated up to US$80,000 for legal/registration/implementation costs.
- The DUNA act grants DAOs legal existence, allowing them to enter contracts, open bank accounts, appear in court, and pay taxes—all without interfering with internal DAO operations.

**The blocker:** The DUNA requires at least **100 members** joined by mutual consent for a common nonprofit purpose. P31 currently has **18 pilot families**.

### 3.2 Alabama and West Virginia: Replication of the Model

Alabama (SB277) and West Virginia have replicated the Wyoming DUNA model, demonstrating the framework's portability and growing acceptance across US jurisdictions.

## 4. Strategic Position Summary

| Dimension | P31 Status | Industry Trend | Gap |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----|
| **A2UI** | Custom renderer (aligned) | `@a2ui/react` standard | Migration |
| **MCP Design System** | 15 tools | 32 tools (System Bridge) | Evolution tools, governance tools |
| **Proposal Pattern** | `propose_component`, `propose_icon`, `propose_token` | Emerging | Validation + audit (✅ done) |
| **Legal Wrapper** | 18 pilot families | DUNA (100 members) | Community growth |
| **Network Nation** | 6 of 7 layers | Governance engineering | Legal wrapper + narrative |
| **Love Economy** | LOVE Ledger + DRRP | Theoretically empty | Court admissibility |

## 6. Conclusion

P31 has built six of seven layers of a Network Nation stack. The technology is mature, the design system is complete, and the agentic infrastructure is production-ready. The path forward requires:

1. **Community growth** — expanding from 18 to 100 pilot families to meet the DUNA threshold
2. **Legal wrapper** — filing the Wyoming DUNA application to gain legal recognition
3. **Public narrative** — articulating the vision of functional sovereignty through care, coordination, and commons-based infrastructure

The P31 stack is not just a technical artifact—it is a reference implementation of the Network Nations thesis, demonstrating that communities can build functional sovereignty through shared infrastructure, mutual care, and cryptographic assurance.
