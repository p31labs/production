Records every facet switch so the thread-lock rule is auditable. One line per
switch. The active facet is always in `SESSION-STATE.md`.

|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-29 | (start) | V — verification gate | build the delivery mechanism first |
| 2026-09-29 | V | C — context protocol | V committed; context is the next delivery layer |
| 2026-09-29 | C | P — parallel paths | C committed; decomposition needed before payload |
| 2026-09-29 | P | S — synthesis | P committed; converge the delivery mechanism |
