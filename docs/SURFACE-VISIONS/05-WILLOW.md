- **K4 Hero animations:** Spoon-aware CSS from `k4-hero.css`
- **Panel transitions:** Direct swap (no animated transitions)
- **Theme transitions:** `transition: background-color 0.8s ease` when spoon level changes
- **Reduced motion:** All animations respect `data-spoons` and `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Gemini Prompt Notes

- Willow is a **child companion app** — friendly, warm, simple
- The 6-screen panel system is the core navigation pattern
- K4 Hero is in the header (smaller than landing surfaces)
- Theme changes with spoon level — crisis (red), sanctuary (violet), quantum (cyan)
- PostMessage API enables embedding in PHOS or hub pages
- Keep the layout centered and focused — one activity at a time
- Drawing and voice are the primary creative tools
