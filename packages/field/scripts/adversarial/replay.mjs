/**
 * @p31ca/field — adversarial/replay.mjs
 *
 * The falsification harness. It reconstructs the conditions of "The
 * Organizational Physics of Multi-Agent AI" (2026-02): N concurrent agents
 * each completing their local interface, and asks whether the boundaries
 * between them close into a coherent whole.
 *
 * We do NOT call an LLM — the Field's substrate has no model calls, and the
 * counter-evidence's point is topological, not linguistic. The model is the
 * Sierpiński composition: every agent locally completes its cell (β₂ = 1 in
 * the cell), and we measure whether the GLOBAL structure encloses (β₂ = 1
 * overall). The answer is known to be "no" — that is the finding the paper
 * reported as "incompatible interfaces at every boundary."
 *
 * The harness exists so that the answer is MEASURED, not asserted. A future
 * Field topology that composes local rigidity into global enclosure would
 * flip this harness's output, and the harness must be able to report that
 * too.
