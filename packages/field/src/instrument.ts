/**
 * @p31ca/field — instrument.ts
 *
 * The Instrument — the UI substrate that scales with the system.
 *
 * Not a portal, not a dashboard. An instrument is not a window onto data;
 * its state IS the data, read through a fixed grammar. A thermometer does
 * not render a chart of temperatures; it moves, and the movement is the
 * reading.
 *
 * The instrument projects (zones, traces, atMs) into a Reading — a pure,
 * deterministic function. Three properties make it scale with the system
 * rather than against it:
 *
 *  1. A clock. Decay is applied at every projection. A zone the field has
 *     stopped touching cools; the reading changes as the field changes. The
 *     interface is alive because the system is alive.
 *
 *  2. A scale chosen by system state, not user preference. At the coarsest
 *     scale, the field is a constellation of zone-dots; zoom reveals a zone's
 *     K₄; zoom again reveals its traces. Zoom is vertical: the same system at
 *     three resolutions.
 *
 *  3. Complexity is measured, not managed. Shannon entropy, edge density, and
 *     white-space ratio are first-class readings. If the interface is failing
 *     to scale, that is a reading — not a rendering bug, but a signal that the
 *     system's structure needs intervention.
 *
 * The instrument is the field, made visible. Pure: no I/O, no model call, no
 * DOM. A reading at a given atMs is byte-identical across runs.
