/**
 * @p31ca/field — sierpinski.ts
 *
 * The Sierpiński gasket — the Field's own failure mode, named.
 *
 * The gasket is built by an identical local rule at every level: replace a
 * triangle with three smaller triangles, ad infinitum. Every cell is a
 * triangle — complete, connected, locally "rigid" in the 2D sense. Yet the
 * whole has β₂ = 0 at every level: it never encloses a volume, no matter how
 * deep the recursion goes.
 *
 * This is the topological statement of the counter-evidence in "The
 * Organizational Physics of Multi-Agent AI" (2026-02): the 8-agent stigmergic
 * swarm "produced incompatible interfaces at every boundary." Every local
 * agent did its job; the global structure never closed. Local completeness
 * does not compose to global enclosure.
 *
 * The Field's Zone is K₄ — β₂ = 1, one protected interior. The Sierpiński
 * gasket is the warning that a field whose zones are individually K₄ can
 * still have β₂ = 0 globally. The gap is what the falsification lane tests.
