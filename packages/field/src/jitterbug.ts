 * @p31ca/field — jitterbug.ts
 *
 * The Jitterbug — the Field's closure, named. The topological twin of
 * sierpinski.ts.
 *
 * Buckminster Fuller's "jitterbug" (Synergetics §460–461, proposed 1948) is
 * the contraction of the cuboctahedron (vector equilibrium) through the
 * icosahedron and octahedron to the tetrahedron. The vector equilibrium is
 * the open state — "constructed with circumferential vectors only," its
 * square faces are unstable and it encloses no protected interior. The
 * tetrahedron is the closed state — "the minimum-limit-case structural
 * system of Universe" (§402), four vertices, six edges, one enclosed volume.
 *
 * Where the Sierpiński gasket shows a field can be locally complete (β₂ = 1
 * per zone) yet globally open (β₂ = 0), the Jitterbug is the operation that
 * closes it: the contraction that collapses many open cells into one
 * enclosed K₄. The gasket stays β₂ = 0 at every level; the jitterbug ends
 * at β₂ = 1. That is the duality.
 *
 * The phases are Fuller's "click-stops" (Synergetics 2, Fig. 1033.43), with
 * his exact volumes in unit-tetrahedron accounting (tetrahedron = 1):
 *
 *   vector equilibrium   V=12  E=24  volume 20          β₂ = 0  (open)
 *   icosahedron          V=12  E=30  volume 18.512…     β₂ = 0  (golden ratio
 *                                                               enters; the
 *                                                               square faces
 *                                                               split into
 *                                                               triangles)
 *   octahedron           V=6   E=12  volume 4           β₂ = 0
 *   tetrahedron          V=4   E=6   volume 1           β₂ = 1  (closed)
 *
 * The β₂/rigid convention is the Field's own, from makeZone: β₂ = 1 and
 * rigid = true iff the 1-skeleton is a complete K₄ (4 vertices, 6 edges) —
 * the tetrahedron. Only the terminal phase satisfies it. (The icosahedron and
 * octahedron also pass Maxwell's isostatic count |E| = 3|V| − 6; the Field
 * does not call them "rigid" because it reserves the word for the K₄, and
 * this module honors that.)
 *
 * The geometry is real physics, not metaphor: a DNA-origami jitterbug was
 * published in Nature Communications (Seo et al., June 2026), reconfiguring
 * on chemical and optical signals with a Poisson's ratio of −1.
