/**
 * @p31ca/quantum-core/src/feedbackLoop.ts — Phase 5: close the ring.
 *
 * ⚠️ HONEST LABEL
 * Contested-science metaphor made literal (see sicPovm.ts, morphogeneticField.ts).
 * No medical or scientific claims.
 *
 * This module turns four isolated engines (SIC-POVM measurement, K₄ skeleton,
 * Posner coherence, morphogenetic layout) into ONE self-adapting machine by
 * feeding observed OUTCOMES back into the SIC-POVM density-matrix inputs:
 *
 *      measureShipState(ρ) ──▶ mode probabilities  (Phase 1)
 *                │                     │
 *                │             user acts on the surface
 *                │        (transmits, coherence, care accrues)
 *                ▼                     ▼
 *        ┌───────────────── FeedbackState (EWMA memory) ◀──┐
 *        │  running engagement / coherence / care          │
 *        └──▶ modulates the NEXT ρ inputs ─────────────────┘
 *
 * The feedback is a bounded exponential-moving-average: a single event nudges
 * the running state; sustained events accumulate. This makes ρ evolve over the
 * session instead of snapping to whatever the spoon slider says. The machine
 * "remembers" that the user has been connecting, and biases the SIC-POVM
 * off-diagonal (connection) + well-being axis accordingly.
 *
