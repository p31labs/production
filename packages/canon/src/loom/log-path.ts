/**
 * @p31ca/canon — loom/log-path.ts
 *
 * The single source of truth for resolving the shared event log path. Node-only.
 *
 * `process.env.LOOM_LOG` wins. Otherwise walk up from the current working
 * directory to the first directory containing `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (the repo
 * root) and resolve `.loom/events.jsonl` there. cwd-based, not import.meta.url
 * based, so it survives Vite's config bundling.
 *
 * Both lanes import this: the β-2 canvas dev middleware and seed/demo scripts,
 * and the β-1 presence handlers. Two different defaults is the difference
 * between convergence passing and passing against an empty log on one side.
