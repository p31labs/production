/**
 * @p31ca/canon — loom/commit.ts
 *
 * The single WARP write path. Every writer — the human CLI, the presence
 * server, the canvas, any agent — appends through commit(). It is the only
 * function that touches the artifact log for writes. (The weft has its own
 * sealed path: commitWeft.ts. Both share the append + lock primitives in
 * jsonl-append.internal.ts.)
 *
 * Invariant: commit(logPath, input) either (a) validates through ReplayGate,
 * persists via appendEvent, and returns the stamped event, or (b) returns an
 * error and writes nothing. There is no third outcome.
 *
 * Concurrency: commit() holds an exclusive lock file for the duration of
 * read → validate → append. Two processes committing simultaneously serialize;
 * the second sees the first's event and is stamped a later seq. Without this,
 * two processes both read seq 41, both stamp 42, and the log has a duplicate
 * seq — a determinism violation, not a nit.
