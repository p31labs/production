/**
 * @p31ca/canon — loom/love.ts
 *
 * The LOVE care-proof derivation, as a shared substrate. Path α (the Loom's
 * Pages Functions + dev middleware) and Path β (future MCP surface) both
 * consume the same pure verdict: given a DID and the ledger's balance shape,
 * derive what the Loom is allowed to show — a care score, a verified verdict,
 * the sovereignty/performance pools — and NOTHING else.
 *
 * The privacy promise is structural: this module never sees or returns the
 * care events. It folds a balance into a proof, and the ledger read happens
 * one layer up (apps/loom/functions/api/loom/_lib/love.ts), which only ever
 * calls the ledger's GET /api/love/balance/:did.
 *
 * The verified threshold mirrors the ledger's CARE_THRESHOLD (0.5) and the
 * on-chain ProofOfCare CARE_THRESHOLD = 0.5e18.
