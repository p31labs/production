/**
 * @p31ca/canon — loom/hash-chain.ts
 *
 * The tamper-evidence layer for The Loom's log. A single `prev_hash` field on
 * each stored record turns an *ordered* log into a *linked* one: rewriting,
 * reordering, or deleting any row breaks the chain at the next row, and
 * `/verify` recomputes the chain and returns exactly where.
 *
 * The hash input is RFC 8785 canonical JSON (JCS): keys sorted, no
 * insignificant whitespace, numbers serialized via ECMAScript Number::toString
 * (which is what JSON.stringify already does for the values the loom stores).
 * A chain computed here is byte-identical on the edge (Workers), in Node (the
 * dev middleware), and in a test — same bytes, same SHA-256, same verdict.
 *
 * Edge-safe by construction: uses only WebCrypto (crypto.subtle) and TextEncoder,
 * which exist in Workers, Node ≥ 20, and browsers. No node: imports, no fs.
 *
 * This module is a SHARED substrate like gate.ts/events.ts — Path α (the
 * D1-backed Pages Functions) and Path β (the dev middleware / future MCP
 * server) both import it. Do not fork the two paths against a different hash.
