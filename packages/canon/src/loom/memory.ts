/**
 * @p31ca/canon — loom/memory.ts
 *
 * Lumi's persistent memory, as a pure fold over the event log.
 *
 * Four tiers, per the AEGIS family-memory pattern:
 *   - episodic  — what happened: the recent shared events, named by codename
 *   - semantic  — what matters: the child's color, the nodes that recur
 *   - procedural — what works: which proposals were approved, what landed
 *   - narrative — the arc, as ONE plain sentence ("you and Lumi made N things")
 *
 * The fold is DETERMINISTIC — no LLM on the critical path. The same events
 * always fold to the same memory. AI phrasing is a separate, gated increment
 * (a missing binding degrades to this deterministic sentence, never to a
 * blank or an error).
 *
 * Edge-safe + pure: no imports beyond the types, works in Workers, Node, and
 * tests. Shared substrate — Path α (the Worker's LumiMemoryDO + Pages
 * Functions) and Path β (the dev middleware) both consume this same fold so
 * the edge and the dev server never disagree about what Lumi remembers.
 *
 * Scope: the fold reads SHARED events only (the read path already scoped
 * them). Personal preferences that a child shared via an agent proposal are
 * in the log as shared `propose` events (the agent formalized the child's
 * idea), so the semantic tier sees them without ever touching a personal
 * record.
