/**
 * @p31ca/canon — loom/project.ts
 *
 * THE paradigm function. `replay()` folds the warp into canonical state.
 * `project()` folds the warp AND the weft through a viewer.
 *
 *   project(warp, weft, viewer, { warpSeq, weftAt? }) → Projection
 *
 * It answers: given the artifact log up to `warpSeq`, and the read log up to
 * `weftAt` (default: the weft head), what does `viewer` see? It returns the
 * canonical warp state plus the viewer's reads — mode, pins, scrub — filtered
 * by the warp seq each read was emitted against.
 *
 * Pure. No model call, no I/O, no mutation. If a model ever enters this path,
 * the determinism contract dies; a model-assisted view is a third-order
 * projection built ON TOP of this, never inside it.
